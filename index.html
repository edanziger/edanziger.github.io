							<div class="ptfblurb">I tried various adaptation strategies.  Rather than use the iOS off-the-shelf tab bar control, I created a custom one for a more Blurb-branded feel.

							<div class="ptfcoverheadline indented">I helped people create books through a simpler interface.</div>
							<div class="ptfcoverdate indented">Spring 2012</div>
							<div class="ptfblurb indented">I worked on Blurb’s “Instabook” product, aimed at casual bookmakers who want to make quick keepsakes from their Facebook and Instagram photos.  The product hadn’t been updated after Facebook albums came into vogue, and usage was below expectations.  I was on the team tasked with improving the experience.  After several months of design and development, book completion (and revenue) went up and the project was considered a success.</div>

						<div class="col-md-4 col-xs-4">
							<div class="ptfblurb">The product manager had data showing that users were gathering photos from multiple Facebook albums, a use case that hadn’t been common when the interface was designed.  A heuristic analysis suggested to us that as users went through their journey of selecting photos, they would lose track of photos they’d chosen from other albums.  I proposed a “hopper” at the right, giving users a rough preview of the book they were constructing and a feeling of progress. After a prototype tested well, we built it.</div>

						<div class="col-md-4 col-xs-4">
							<div class="ptfblurb">In discussions with the product manager and the Chief Product Officer, another observation came up — users were suffering “paralysis by analysis” when confronted with the many tools in the interface, and dropping off in the middle of creation.  To speed them through, we put only the simplest controls in the main interface, and added a small “Switch to Advanced Editing” button at the upper right that launched a different mode (signaled by a different background) with more complex editing features.</div>

							<div class="ptfblurb">Finally, we knew users were dropping off during a processing step, which could take a minute or two.  I suggested using this downtime for adding a book title and author name, which we could let users preview as they typed.  Afterward we could also show a sample spread while the book was generated, with a reassuring message below.<br><br>The net result of these changes was a better experience that improved conversions and helped more people preserve their digital memories in high-quality photo books.</div>
