							<div class="ptfblurb indented">I work for Ellucian, the creator of higher-education software used by more than 2,400 colleges and universities in the US and abroad. I focus on Ellucian’s newest offering, Brainstorm, a learning platform for the growing movement known as Competency-Based Education.  Brainstorm is built for self-paced courses that include substantive interaction with an instructor — increasingly seen as the ideal way for adult students in many disciplines to learn.</div>

							<div class="ptfblurb">One of my first assignments was to update Brainstorm’s visuals.  A sample screen as I inherited it and as it is now are shown in the animated reveal to the left.  There were plenty of technical challenges — across dozens of page layouts and page elements, changes had to be almost entirely limited to CSS. Building a consensus around a new visual direction is always a feat of persuasion, but I managed it, and the end result has had a very positive reception internally and externally.</div>

							<div class="ptfblurb">UX has been as much a part of my job as UI detailing.  Ellucian believes strongly in user testing to ensure an excellent user experience, and in spring 2016 the 30-person UX department organized a large-scale, in-person testing effort. I conducted eight scripted tests for my product.  I analyzed and shared my results, including screen-by-screen observations supported by user quotes.  I made recommendations for improvement, and we have implemented a number already.</div>

The graphics to the left indicate how I presented the problem and solution to internal stakeholders to raise awareness, gather feedback, and build consensus for a fix.<br><br>My work at Ellucian has also included new product features, refinements, and special projects — including a big one around responsive design.</div>

Pearson, recognizing this, engaged the agency I worked for to create hundreds of small interactives for higher-education textbooks.  My work designing and coordinating the development of these interactives led to a huge ramping-up of our work for Pearson and other publishers, and to my promotion to management.</div>

Sometimes, as in the case of an art history gallery, they then requested multiple ideas for a “widget.”  My team and I produced seven concepts for using interactivity to weave together image and description.  In the enlarged scheme, I sought to include a “concept map” at the left, showing the student how each image in the gallery related to the others.</div>

							<div class="ptfblurb">Eventually Metrodigi’s work for Pearson became so extensive that we needed to scale our operations.  I led our team in creating a private web app that allowed us to track thousands of interactives across dozens of titles.  We included workflow tools so that authors and editors could input material for now-standardized interactive types, and eventually we offered a WYSIWYG interface so interactives could be created by the client without our committing developer time.  We ultimately outproduced and outcompeted our better-funded rival, Inkling.</div>

Part medical expert system, part dosage calculator, part instructional guide, it captures all the nuances of newborn medical protocol to ensure the highest standard of care.

							<div class="ptfblurb indented">Blurb Mobile is an iOS app for weaving photos, videos, and audio into short, shareable multimedia stories.  My main task was to adapt the iPhone version for the recently released iPad.  I needed to create a design for the larger form factor, while adhering to the basic architecture and visual style of the original app.  I also did most of the engineering work for the iPad adaptation.<br><br>One of the new interactions I most enjoyed creating was a swipeable toolbar used to toggle between view and edit mode.</div>

							<div class="ptfblurb">In adapting the app, I created a custom tab bar control for a more Blurb-branded feel and streamlined the interface.  For example, detailed story metadata was hidden behind an info icon, which on the phone opened a separate metadata page. On the iPad, I could show the metadata in a translucent overlay animating out over the story thumbnails.  Throughout, I needed to find ways to rethink groups of phone-sized pages, sometimes creating a combined page, other times embedding secondary pages in popovers displayed on the primary page.</div>

							<div class="ptfblurb indented">Blurb offers several digital products to let people create professional print books.  I worked on the “Instabook” product, aimed at casual bookmakers who want to quickly turn digital memories from Facebook or Instagram into printed keepsakes.  The product hadn’t been updated after Facebook albums came into vogue, and usage had been below expectations.  I was on the team tasked with finding ways to improve the experience.  After several months of design and development, book completion (and revenue) went up and the project was considered a success.</div>

							<div class="ptfblurb">The product manager shared data showing that users were gathering photos from multiple Facebook albums, a use case that hadn’t been common when the interface was designed.  A heuristic analysis suggested to us that as users went through their journey of selecting photos, they would lose track of photos they’d chosen from other albums.  I proposed a “hopper” at the right, which would give users a rough preview of the book they were constructing and a feeling of progress. After a prototype tested well, we built it.</div>

							<div class="ptfblurb">In discussions with the product manager and the Chief Product Officer, another observation came up — users were suffering “paralysis by analysis” when confronted with the many tools in the interface, and dropping off in the middle of creation.  To speed them through, we put only the simplest controls in the main interface, and added a small “Switch to Advanced Editing” button at the upper right that launched a different mode (signaled by a different background) with more complex editing features.</div>

I suggested using this downtime for a simple but essential step in the book process — adding a book title and author name, which we could let users preview as they typed.  Afterward we could also show a sample spread while the book was generated, with a reassuring message below.<br><br>The net result of these changes was a better experience that improved conversions and helped more people preserve their digital memories in high-quality photo books.</div>
